# Data Analytics Algorithms Research

### What Are They?

Data analytics algorithms are instructions that help computers analyze information and find patterns.

### 5 Types of algorithms

##### 1. **Counting & Calculating**

Adds up numbers and finds averages.

Real example: Finding the average grade in a class

- Add all grades: 80 + 90 + 70 = 240
- Divide by number of students: 240 รท 3 = 80 average

###### 2. **Sorting**

Puts things in order.

Real example: Organizing scores from lowest to highest

- Before: 90, 70, 85
- After: 70, 85, 90

##### 3. **Grouping**

Puts similar things together.

Real example: Grouping students by favorite subject

- Math lovers: Emma, John
- Science lovers: Sarah, Mike
- Art lovers: Lisa, Tom

##### 4. **Predicting**

Guesses what might happen next based on past data.

Real example: Predicting tomorrow's temperature based on the last week's weather

##### 5. **Categorizing**

Decides which category something belongs to.

Real example: Email sorting

- Is this spam? -> Yes or No
- If yes -> Goes to spam folder
- If no -> Goes to inbox

#### How They're Used

- Spotify recommendations
- Netflix suggestions
- Amazon product recommendations
- Email spam filters
- Google Maps traffic predictions

#### Which One to use

- Need to add/average numbers? -> Counting
- Need to organize items? -> Sorting
- Need to find similar things? -> Grouping
- Need to guess the future? -> Predicting
- Need to label things? -> Categorizing

**App Example**
Which student needs help?

**Steps:**

1. Count each student's correct answers
2. Calculate their percentage score
3. Sort from lowest to highest
4. Categorize performance (Good, Fair, Poor)
5. Students with "Poor" need help
