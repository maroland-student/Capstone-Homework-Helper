# AI Homework Helper

## Project Overview

The **AI Homework Helper** is an intelligent Algebra 1 learning assistant designed to help students master key math concepts. It allows users to type or upload their homework questions, automatically generating clear, step-by-step explanations to reinforce understanding.

The system includes **AI-powered image recognition** for handwritten problems and an **interactive graphing tool** for visualizing equations. It also tracks each studentâ€™s progress and automatically sends summary reports to teachers to highlight learning gaps.

By combining AI technology with educational best practices, this project helps students not only complete their homework but also build confidence and deeper comprehension in Algebra 1.
