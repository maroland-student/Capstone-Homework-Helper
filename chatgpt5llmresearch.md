# ChatGPT-5 LLM Research: Equation Extraction Capabilities and Pricing

## Overview

This research shows ChatGPT-5s abilities for extracting math equations,
especially from text, along with the pricing, when compared to
other LLMs. Overall it was decided CHATGPT 5 is th best choice
from this research due to its abilities and its pricing.

## Why ChatGPT-5 for Equation Extraction

### Reduced Hallucination Rates

ChatGPT-5 has the most improvements compared to other models
regarding accuracy. There are benchmark tests showing that the
hallucination rate is grounded of 1.4% which is lower than GPT-4s
1.8% and GPT-4o's 1.49%. This decrease is important due to the fact
this would increase mathmatical accuracy when we are extracting our
equations and realiability.

### Advanced Natural Language Understanding

This model was given the ability to understand very complex
math expressions and their context. This one can convert math
equations from multiple formats including python, latex, and
other representations. This can help us extract from documents,
papers, and other materials in case we need it.

### Practical Applications In Our Project

The Formula Extractor Will Allow Us to:
- Extract math formulas from text
- Convert equations to Python code
- Test formulas with real data
- Process complex mathematical expressions

We will be able to take math equations and extract them to
put them into problems in our code to then create problems
for the students in our homework helper.

### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

When processing large volumes of text for equation extraction, ChatGPT-5 offers significant cost advantages:

1. **Compared to Claude Opus 4.1**: ChatGPT-5 is 12x cheaper for input tokens and 7.5x cheaper for output tokens
2. **Compared to Gemini Pro 2.5**: ChatGPT-5 matches input token pricing but offers lower output token costs
3. **Compared to Grok 4**: ChatGPT-5 is 2.4x cheaper for input tokens and 50% cheaper for output tokens

This cost structure makes ChatGPT-5 particularly attractive for applications involving substantial text processing and equation extraction, where high input volumes are common but output requirements are more modest.

## Technical Advantages for Equation Extraction

### Contextual Understanding

ChatGPT-5's architecture enables it to maintain context across complex mathematical expressions, allowing it to:
- Identify equation boundaries accurately
- Understand the relationship between components
- Preserve mathematical notation and symbols
- Handle multi-line equations and systems of equations

### Format Conversion Capabilities

The model can convert extracted equations into multiple formats:
- LaTeX for academic and research applications
- Python code for computational purposes
- Mathematical notation preservation
- Interactive formula rendering

### Error Reduction

The fact the hallucination rate is improved means that there
are fewer extraction errors. This is very important to us.
This makes 5 suitable for our project since incorrect extraction
can lead to many errors down the line.
