# Better Auth Research Document

Better Auth is a modern, TypeScript-first authentication library designed as an alternative to NextAuth.js and Lucia. It's framework-agnostic, open-source, and provides a comprehensive authentication solution with excellent developer experience. The library emphasizes type safety, flexibility, and a plugin-based architecture that allows developers to extend functionality without modifying core code.

Better Auth supports multiple authentication methods including email/password with verification, OAuth and social login for providers like Google, GitHub, and Discord, magic link passwordless authentication, and two-factor authentication using TOTP. The library handles session management through either JWT or database sessions, utilizing HttpOnly cookies with CSRF protection and providing device and session tracking capabilities.

Database support is comprehensive, covering PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB, with first-class integration for both Prisma and Drizzle ORMs. Security is built-in from the ground up with CSRF protection, rate limiting, encrypted tokens, secure cookies, and configurable password policies to ensure your authentication system meets modern security standards.

The plugin system is one of Better Auth's strongest features, allowing you to extend functionality easily without core modifications. For example, adding two-factor authentication is as simple as importing the plugin and adding it to your configuration. The library provides framework-specific client libraries for React, Vue, Svelte, Solid.js, and vanilla JavaScript, ensuring that regardless of your tech stack, you'll have idiomatic APIs to work with.

The API design is clean and intuitive, with server-side configuration handled through a single betterAuth function where you specify your database provider, social providers, and other options. Client-side authentication is equally straightforward, with methods like signIn.email() and getSession() that are self-explanatory and type-safe.

Better Auth offers several advantages over existing solutions. Its TypeScript support and type inference are superior to most alternatives, providing excellent autocomplete and compile-time safety. Being framework-agnostic means you're not locked into a specific framework like Next.js, and the self-hosted nature ensures no vendor lock-in or usage-based pricing. The extensible plugin architecture makes customization straightforward, and the overall API is more intuitive than many established libraries.

However, there are some challenges to consider. As a newer library, it's less battle-tested than solutions like NextAuth.js, which has been around longer and has a larger community. The smaller ecosystem means you might occasionally need to explore the source code for advanced use cases, and some third-party integrations may require custom implementations rather than plug-and-play solutions.

Compared to NextAuth.js, Better Auth provides better TypeScript support, more flexible session management, and isn't exclusively tied to Next.js. Against Lucia, it offers higher-level abstractions for faster development and more built-in features like OAuth and magic links. When compared to hosted solutions like Clerk or Auth0, Better Auth gives you full control over your data and infrastructure without usage-based pricing, though you sacrifice enterprise support contracts and managed services.

Setting up Better Auth involves choosing your database provider, running the necessary migrations or schema creation, and configuring your connection pooling. You'll need to set environment variables for your database URL, secret keys for encryption, and OAuth provider credentials. Integration requires installing the Better Auth packages, configuring your authentication instance, setting up API routes, and implementing client-side hooks. Testing should cover all authentication flows, session management verification, OAuth integration checks, and load testing of critical endpoints.

Better Auth is an excellent choice when starting a new project with modern authentication requirements, especially if you need flexibility and customization. It's ideal for TypeScript-first development teams and those who want a self-hosted solution without vendor lock-in. The library shines in scenarios where you need fine-grained control over your authentication system and want the ability to extend it through plugins.

However, you might want to consider alternatives in certain situations. If you need enterprise support contracts, hosted solutions like Auth0 or Clerk might be more appropriate. For very simple use cases with minimal requirements, Lucia's lighter footprint might be preferable. If you have an existing NextAuth.js implementation that's working well, the migration cost might not justify the benefits unless you're experiencing specific pain points.

Better Auth represents a compelling option for teams building new applications in 2025 and beyond. Its plugin architecture, TypeScript-first design, and framework-agnostic approach position it well for the future of web development. While the smaller ecosystem compared to established alternatives is worth considering, the benefits of superior type safety, flexibility, and developer experience make it a strong choice for projects that value these qualities. For sprint tasks, the library provides enough built-in functionality to get authentication working quickly while offering the extensibility needed for more complex requirements down the road.
